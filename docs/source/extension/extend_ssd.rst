**Booting RPi from Hard Disk**

To boot Raspberry Pi with Hard Disk, you need to update the Bootloader of Raspberry Pi, then install Raspberry Pi OS on Hard Disk, and finally reboot Raspberry Pi and Hard Disk.

You have 2 methods.

**Using Raspberry Pi Imager**: This method is recommended for newbies, it is easy to operate and less error-prone. But this method will make you lose the contents of your Micro SD card.

**Using Commands**: For users with basic knowledge, you can use this method if you don't want to lose the data of your Micro SD card.
