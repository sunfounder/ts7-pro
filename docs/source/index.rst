This is a 7-inch touch screen with dual-channel speakers and protective cover and stand. High definition display with comfortable viewing angle and good handheld experience.

The onboard buttons can be used to adjust the volume and brightness, as well as turn on/off the screen.

Reserved hard drive mounting position, compatible with 2.5-inch mechanical hard disk and solid state drive. If you use SSD instead of Micro SD card, it can increase the capacity of Raspberry Pi as well as improve the operation speed.

The 40pin interface is also reserved, so you can connect 40pin cable or connect sensors directly to ensure the scalability of Raspberry Pi.

Ideal for applications like retro gaming, industrial control, as a secondary monitor, in home automation, for 3D printing control, and as a |link-pc-monitor|.
