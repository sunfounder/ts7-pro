The onboard buttons can be used to adjust the volume and brightness, as well as turn on/off the screen.

Reserved hard drive mounting position, compatible with 2.5-inch mechanical hard disk and solid state drive. If you use SSD instead of Micro SD card, it can increase the capacity of Raspberry Pi as well as improve the operation speed.
